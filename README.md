**Project Description:**
Cough is a common symptom of respiratory diseases and the sound of cough can be indicative of the respiratory condition. Objective cough sound analysis has the potential to aid the assessment of the respiratory condition. Cough sound segmentation is an important step in objective cough sound analysis. 

This project focuses on developing methods to segment cough sounds from audio recordings. The students will explore various signal processing techniques, such temporal and spectral analysis, to identify distinctive features of coughs. Through machine learning algorithms, they'll create a classification model capable of distinguishing cough sounds from non-cough sounds.
