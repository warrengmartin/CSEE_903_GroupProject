**Project Description:**
Cough is a common symptom of respiratory diseases and the sound of cough can be indicative of the respiratory condition. Objective cough sound analysis has the potential to aid the assessment of the respiratory condition. Cough sound segmentation is an important step in objective cough sound analysis. This project focuses on developing methods to segment cough sounds from audio recordings. The students will explore various signal processing techniques, such temporal and spectral analysis, to identify distinctive features of coughs. Through machine learning algorithms, they'll create a classification model capable of distinguishing cough sounds from non-cough sounds. The students will also develop cough sound denoising algorithms for cough sound segmentation in noisy environments.

# Github Usage Strategy
To efficiently use GitHub for our project, I propose a streamlined strategy:

1. **Central Repository**: Set up one repository on GitHub where all project files will be stored.

2. **Branching Model**: Use the "Feature Branch Workflow":
   - **Main Branch**: Only stable, production-ready code.
   - **Feature Branches**: Individual branches for each feature or task.
      - Example 1: Data loading
      - Example 2: Feature Transformation
      - Example 3: Machine Learning Models

3. **Commit Messages**: Ensure commit messages are clear and descriptive.

4. **Pull Requests and Reviews**: Merge code using pull requests and perform code reviews to maintain quality.

5. **Issue Tracking**: Utilize GitHub’s issue tracking to manage and assign tasks.

6. **Regular Updates**: Frequently update and push changes to minimize conflicts and keep all team members aligned.

7. **Documentation**: Store all essential project documentation in the repository in markdown files (README, CONTRIBUTING).
